SQL Alchemy Exercise

The Exercise went really well up until the testing - and even that went fairly well for the most part. 
My issues started with testing the post requests.  What I'm doing follows the model the provided us,
but I keep getting a 405 error code when I run my test file.  After checking a ton of different things,
I went back to the code provided to us for the demo during the videos, and the post request from that
also returns the same 405 error code.  Maybe you have some idea what's happening?

Here's the message I get in my terminal:
FAIL: test_add_user (test_flask.BloglyTestCase)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/megan/springboard_projects/sqlA_Blogly/test_flask.py", line 88, in test_add_user
    self.assertEqual(resp.status_code, 200)
AssertionError: 405 != 200


Also I'm curious about data validation.  Is there a reason to use the wtf validation over the 
html validation?  I had done a code challenge for an internship this week which involved data
validation, and I managed it with only html. So I was curios - besides the CSRF security, is there
any other major reasons to use wtflask?
